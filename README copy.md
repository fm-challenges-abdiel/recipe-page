## My process

- Structure HTML with semantic tags
- Structure CSS with mobile first approach
- Adjust paddings and sizes
- Using flex properties to proportionally expand
- Desktop version comes inherit

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first design

### What I learned

This time I found a way faster to finish this project whithout struggling too much with space and size.

### I'm proud of my code

I'm proud of my whole css code and almost all my HTML one, even if there are some characteristics that i need to improve, and instead following frontend-mentor exact design, I decided to add some of my own, making the mobile version to look good and making it to no have an innecesary scroll down (at least for me).

### Continued development

This practices are helping me too much to improve my designs even more and for sure I'll continue with this practices.
